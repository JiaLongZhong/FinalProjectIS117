                        <h1>Browser War:</h1>
                        <p>The video "Browser Wars" in the series "The True Story of the Internet" is a very interesting documentary/video that talks about the internet browser that
                            talks about the "wars" that had ensued from competition trying to capture customers for the internet browser. In order to know the internet in and out
                            you should know the history of the internet browser and what the browser had to go through in order for you to have your product that you have now.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>First graphical web browser was Mosaic in 1993 which triggered a browser war.</li>
                        </ul>

                        <p>Once people realized the true potential of a graphical web browser it had caused many companies to develop their own and try to compete.</p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Jim Clark, who founded several Silicon Valley companies, helped bring the cash to fund the creation of Mosaic.</li>
                            <li>Bill Gates created the Microsoft Network in 1994 with the primary goal of profit and control.</li>
                            <li>Netscape Communications established in 1994and created a new web browser, Navigator, in the same year.</li>
                            <li>Once Netscape gained the attention of Bill Gates and Microsoft, both companies would be in a race to be constantly producing and updating their products to stand out from the other company.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>When NetSpace was doing well Microsoft wanted to capture that demand so they had offered NetSpace $1,000,000 to buy out all of their software. Netscape had declined. After this they had went public and their stock had skyrocketed. In response to do this Microsoft did a couple of things: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Microsoft released Internet Explorer.</li>
                            <li>Microsoft used salesmen and predatorial tactics to sell Microsoft browsers and ensure that companies were not using Netscape products.</li>
                            <li>Internet Explorer was a free web browser unlike Netscape’s products since Microsoft’s browsers came with their operating system.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Eventually the browser wars were coming to a close. Events had happened with concluded the war: </p>
                        <ul>
                            <li>Netscape was bought out by AOL in 1999 for $10 billion.</li>
                            <li>Microsoft was under investigation in 1998 by the U.S. government accused of using illegal tactics to ensure their monopoly.</li>
                            <li>Bill Gates was not cooperative during the trials and was consistently denying accusations.</li>
                            <li>The company was found to be guilty of using abusive tactics and was told to be split into two companies. However,the decision was later reversed,and Bill Gates stepped down from his position as CEO.</li>
                        </ul>
                        <p>Overall these wars seemed very hectic at the time but they had brought lots of competition and because of this competition we have the browsers we use today.</p>
