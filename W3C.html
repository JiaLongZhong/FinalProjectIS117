                        <h1>W3C & HTML & CSS:</h1>
                        <p>World Wide Web Consortium (W3C) was the standard organization for Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) and Hypertext Markup Language (HTML). HTML is the language used to design a webpage. CSS is the style sheet that formats the webpage.</p>
                        <p>Majority of the Webpage are created with HTML (Hypertext Markup Language), which is basically the computer language used to create a Webpage. HTML is support by all type of web-browser. Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Firefox, and many more. To create a webpage, programmer will need to use the HTML tags. Which is the root of all HTML document. </p>
                        <p>In the past, webpage were static containing mostly of texts and images. But nowadays, web designer used more interaction content. For example, the ability to shift the background photo to another just by pointing your mouse at it. Or signing in button changing color when pressed. Those webpages are known as dynamic webpage and the content is call dynamic content. This however doesn’t mean that webpage is non-static because the webpage is still mostly static. </p>
                        <p>The only way for a webpage to contain dynamic content is to provide HTML a set of instructions. This process is called scripting and the set of instruction are known as script. Those instruction can only be use under certain condition. For instance: it is common practice to provide a statement when a person successfully login into their account. The condition for this to happen is self-explanatory. The point of web scripting is for small program to executed based on user interaction with the webpage. It widely used for web development because it allow user to interact with the webpage then just looking at its image and text. </p>
                        <p>Cascading Style Sheets (CSS) is responsible for the style of the web page. It does that by showing how HTML elements are displayed on the screen, paper, or in other media. For example: all the colors, fonts, and positioning of the elements are all cause by CSS.  Basically, CCS is what make a webpage look good, it the fashion of webpage. Without CCS all the webpage will look redundant, everything will be from top to bottom, left to right, without any background image or colorful box with information in it. People are very visual being, and without CSS, all the web pages will just look dull. For example: Look at the home page website for any class in canvas. You see the callout boxes, and multiple tables with week and assignment in them. In the other hand without CSS it look like a website create in the 1980. If you want to see any website without CSS, you can download the web developer extension in chrome and remove all style.</p>
